# Namaste, I'm [Your Name]! üëã

> Dev-something enthusiast bridging AI and full-stack development üöÄ

## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me
My tech journey began early‚Äîat age 10, I started coding in QBasic, which led me through web development to my current focus on AI and machine learning. My experiences have shaped me into a full-stack developer with a knack for intelligent, practical solutions. As an AWS AI & ML Scholarship recipient, I've built several applications, such as an **AI short video generator** and a **React Native AI trip planner**, demonstrating the impact of ML in both web and mobile spaces.

Currently, I'm exploring Go and scalable systems to enhance my skillset in infrastructure and systems design.
